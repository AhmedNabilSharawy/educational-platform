# CI/CD Strategy

The CI/CD pipelines are designed to support automated, secure, and scalable deployments across multiple services, environments, and regions.

## Pipeline Overview

Each application component (monolith, microservices, frontend) has its own pipeline with the following key stages:

- **Build**:
  - Linting and code quality checks (e.g., PHPStan, ESLint).
  - Unit and integration tests.
  - Container image build and scan (e.g., Trivy).
- **Test**:
  - Test in isolated namespaces using ephemeral environments.
  - Security scans and code analysis (e.g., SonarQube).
- **Deploy**:
  - Canary deployments and rollout strategies.
  - Environment-specific Helm values or Kustomize overlays.
  - Deployment to regional EKS clusters.

## Tools Used

- **Source Control**: GitHub.
- **CI/CD Engine**: GitHub Actions.
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform and Helm.
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Security**: Trivy for vulnerability scanning.

## Deployment Targets

- **Staging**: Full stack deployed for UAT and integration testing.
- **Production**:
  - Deployed to U.S. and Saudi regions.
  - Blue-green or canary rollout per region.

## Best Practices

- Immutable deployments via containerization.
- Rollbacks enabled via Helm revision history.
- Artifact versioning using Git commit hashes.
- Notifications via Slack or email on pipeline events.
