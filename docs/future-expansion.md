# Future Expansion and Extensibility

The KnowledgeCity architecture is built with future scalability and extensibility in mind. It supports seamless integration of new services, regions, and technologies without disrupting the existing system.

## Adding New Microservices

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Each new microservice comes with its own build, test, and deploy pipeline.

## Adding New Regions

- **Region Templates**: Terraform modules or Helm charts can replicate architecture in new regions.
- **Data Residency**: Services and storage comply with local data regulations.
- **DNS Routing**: Global routing via Route 53 latency-based or geolocation policies.

## Developer Enablement

- **Documentation**: Each component is documented with API specs, usage, and deployment guides.
