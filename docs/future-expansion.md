# Future Expansion and Extensibility

The KnowledgeCity architecture is built with future scalability and extensibility in mind. It supports seamless integration of new services, regions, and technologies without disrupting the existing system.

## Adding New Microservices

- **Microservice Isolation**: Every microservice runs in its own Kubernetes namespace for security and autonomy.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized ingress via API Gateway for secure and versioned APIs.
- **Service Discovery**: Leveraging Kubernetes-native DNS and optional service mesh like Istio for complex routing.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Each new microservice comes with its own build, test, and deploy pipeline.
- **Scalable Storage**: Microservices can attach to shared S3 buckets or request dedicated databases.

## Adding New Regions

- **Region Templates**: Terraform modules or Helm charts can replicate architecture in new regions.
- **Data Residency**: Services and storage comply with local data regulations.
- **DNS Routing**: Global routing via Route 53 latency-based or geolocation policies.

## Adding New Frontends or Channels

- **Multi-Tenant SPA**: Easily extendable React frontend for different user roles or markets.
- **Mobile Apps / TV Apps**: Can reuse backend APIs and CDNs already provisioned.

## Developer Enablement

- **Internal Developer Platform**: Streamlined onboarding to deploy new services quickly.
- **Documentation**: Each component is documented with API specs, usage, and deployment guides.
- **Monitoring by Default**: All services include baseline metrics, logging, and alerting out of the box.

## Use Cases

- Launching a new feature-specific microservice (e.g., real-time quizzes).
- Expanding to EU region with GDPR-compliant storage and services.
- Onboarding third-party developers via documented APIs.
