# Future Growth and Extensibility

As the platform evolves, the architecture is designed to support the seamless addition of new services, regions, and scaling needs.

## Adding New Microservices

- **Microservices Pattern**: Services are deployed as independent containers in Amazon EKS.
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Use of Amazon EventBridge for loosely coupled communication.
- **Service Discovery**: Internal DNS within the cluster and service mesh (e.g., Istio) for routing.
- **Deployment**: Each microservice can be deployed using independent CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

## Scaling to New Regions

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform templates make provisioning new regions repeatable and version-controlled.
- **CI/CD Adjustments**: Pipeline templates support multi-region deploys with region-specific configurations.
- **Compliance Ready**: New regions inherit data residency and encryption policies via IaC modules.

## Database & Storage Extension

- **Sharded Architecture**: ClickHouse supports horizontal partitioning for analytics.
- **Region-specific RDS clusters**: Easily provisioned and replicated via Terraform.
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Video/content in S3 uses AWS replication rules for global availability.

## Observability at Scale

- **Prometheus Federation**: Scrapes metrics from clusters across multiple regions.
- **Central Logging**: Logs shipped to OpenSearch/ELK clusters with region tags.
- **Dashboards**: Grafana uses templated dashboards for new services and regions.

## Resilience by Design

- **Service Mesh Support**: Istio or Linkerd enables retries, failover, and rate limiting.
- **Readiness Probes**: Kubernetes liveness/readiness checks ensure pods are rotated correctly.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Periodic testing with tools like Litmus or AWS Fault Injection Simulator.
