# Media Processing and Global Delivery

This section outlines how raw video content is ingested, processed, stored, and served to users worldwide.

---

## 📥 Video Upload and Ingestion

- Instructors upload raw course videos through the web frontend.
- Uploaded files are stored in an **S3 bucket (Standard or Intelligent-Tiering)**.
- A notification (e.g., via Amazon S3 Event Notification or EventBridge) triggers the video conversion service.

---

## 🎞️ Automated Video Conversion

- A **containerized microservice** (deployed in EKS) performs video transcoding into multiple resolutions and formats (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p).
- Transcoding jobs are queued (SQS or Kinesis) and processed asynchronously.
- Converted outputs are stored back in S3, organized by course ID and quality.

---

## ☁️ Storage Strategy

- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** for optimized cost and retrieval performance.
- Lifecycle policies move rarely accessed content to **Glacier Deep Archive** if needed.
- **Cross-region replication** ensures educational content is available globally and redundantly.

---

## 🌍 Global Video Delivery

- **Amazon CloudFront CDN** caches video content at edge locations worldwide.
- CloudFront distributions are connected to regional S3 buckets (U.S. and Saudi Arabia).
- Route53 with Geo DNS or latency-based routing directs users to the nearest region.

---

## 🔁 Sync and Replication

- Cross-Region Replication is enabled between S3 buckets in U.S. and Saudi regions.
- Ensures both data durability and availability even during outages or spikes in one region.
- Speeds up video access for global users by serving from nearest edge/cache.

---

## 📈 Performance Consideration

- Videos are frequently accessed from CloudFront edge locations, not S3 directly.
- Only on cache-miss does the content get fetched from S3 origin.
- Optimized cache TTLs balance freshness and delivery speed.
