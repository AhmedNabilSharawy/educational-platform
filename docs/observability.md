# Observability Strategy

A comprehensive observability strategy is critical to ensure system reliability, security, and regulatory compliance in a multi-regional architecture like KnowledgeCity.

## Monitoring

Monitoring will be implemented using **Prometheus** and visualized through **Grafana** dashboards.

### Key Metrics
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage per pod/node.
- **Application**: Request rates, error rates, latency (RED metrics).
- **Databases**: Query performance, replication lag, storage growth.
- **Microservices**: Custom business KPIs (e.g., video conversion success/failure rates).

## Logging

All logs will be centrally collected using the **EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit, Kibana)**.

### Logging Approach
- **Structured Logs**: Enforced via log shippers.
- **Centralized Aggregation**: Across all regions using secure ingestion pipelines.
- **Searchability**: Kibana dashboards for per-service log views and alert investigation.

## Tracing

**OpenTelemetry** will be used to enable distributed tracing across services.

### Use Cases
- Track request flow from frontend to backend.
- Identify bottlenecks in microservices and third-party integrations.
- Understand user behavior patterns over time.

## Alerting

Alertmanager (from Prometheus stack) will be configured with thresholds and anomaly detection rules.

### Notification Channels
- Email
- Slack or Microsoft Teams
- PagerDuty for critical outages

## Integration with Security

Observability supports security by:
- **Detecting DDoS patterns** via traffic anomaly monitoring.
- **Auditing access logs** to sensitive data paths.
- **Tracing breaches** across service boundaries.

## Compliance and Forensics

- **Log Retention Policies**: Tailored per region to match regulatory standards.
- **Immutability of Logs**: Achieved via S3 Object Lock and KMS encryption.
- **Audit Dashboards**: For access, error patterns, and recovery events.
