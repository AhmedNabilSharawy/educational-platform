# Optimization and Scalability

This section describes how the platform is designed to scale efficiently while optimizing for cost and performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Auto-Scaling Capabilities

- **Elastic Compute**:
  - Amazon EKS with Cluster Autoscaler to scale nodes.
  - Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) based on CPU/memory usage.

- **Storage Scaling**:
  - Amazon S3 auto-scales with data volume.
  - RDS/Aurora configured with read replicas and auto-scaling storage.

- **Video Conversion & Analytics**:
  - Scaled independently as microservices using KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling).
  - Workers scale up/down based on queue length or events.

## üåç Regional Expansion

- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform or Pulumi makes it easy to replicate stacks in new regions.
- Multi-region Route53 policies (Latency-based routing, GeoDNS) for optimal user redirection.
- Decoupled architecture ensures services and databases can be expanded regionally.

## üí∞ Cost Optimization Strategies

- **Storage**:
  - S3 Intelligent-Tiering for video and course content.
  - Lifecycle policies for archival using S3 Glacier.

- **Compute**:
  - Spot Instances for non-critical jobs (e.g., batch analytics).
  - Use of ARM-based Graviton instances where possible for cost/performance balance.

- **Delivery**:
  - Global CDN (CloudFront) for caching video and static assets near users.
  - Tiered cache policies and edge-optimized delivery to reduce origin fetches.
