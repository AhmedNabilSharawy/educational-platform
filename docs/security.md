# Security, Observability, and Compliance

This section outlines how the platform maintains strong security, visibility, and adherence to regulatory requirements.

## üîê Security Measures

- **Access Control**:
  - IAM roles and policies follow the principle of least privilege.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) across all services.

- **Network Protection**:
  - AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter and block malicious traffic.
  - AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

- **Data Protection**:
  - All data is encrypted at rest (S3, RDS, EBS, etc.) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
  - KMS is used for key management and envelope encryption.

- **Secrets Management**:
  - AWS Secrets Manager or HSSashiCorp Vault for securely storing API keys, DB passwords, etc.

## üîé Observability

- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - **Prometheus + Grafana**: System and app metrics (CPU, memory, response times).
  - **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logs, alarms, and service metrics.
  - **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing and instrumentation.
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **EFK (Fluentd)**: Centralized log management.

- **Key Metrics**:
  - Error rates, request latency, system load, and service health.
  - Security logs, access patterns, and failed auth attempts.

## üìú Compliance and Regulation

- Data is stored and processed in-region (Saudi Arabia, U.S.) to meet data residency laws.
- Continuous vulnerability scanning (e.g., AWS Inspector, Snyk).
- Anomaly detection using machine learning in CloudWatch or external services.
- Easily adaptable to evolving regulations (e.g., Saudi NCA, U.S. HIPAA/FedRAMP).
